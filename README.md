# React Fb Live scenes

React Facebook Live Presentation Web based scenes, for various
times during the presentation. These scenes are built on Web based
technologies and during my React Live stream, I am to stream
them live using awesome [OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)](https://obsproject.com/)
by creating a separate for each of the tab with a scene open in Full Screen.

## Scenes

### Start Scene
[Scene Link](./start/index.html)
The scene will be used at the Start of Stream and will include some information about the Presentaiton
amd when we are going to start presenting.

### Pause Scene


### End Scene

## Follow Link(s)

Follow Links are helpful in increasing the amount of traction, our application receives. We can discuss them in 
every scene, so people watching the stream, know how they can get connected with us.

There are two ways to approach this problem, either suggest the users to Follow Us on Facebook, or give them our
username. The latter might be the better approach as it allows us to build an audience on Facebook, and is much more easier to 
do, natively on Fb.

The styling however, would be same all over the scenes, in order to give it a very consistent look.

## CodePen Credits
I used many of the Codpens in order to make this possible. Without the use of amazing Pens at CodePen
